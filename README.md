To run the project -

- npm run dev

List of things that were on TODO list that I didn't get to do:

- Optimized build config for prod
- Color palette file or theme config to use throughout app
- Mock server to provide changing mock data (json.server)
- .env file for API URL's
- Meeting URL link validation/sanitation
- Unit tests
- Accessibility (aria labels, keyboard navigation/controls)
